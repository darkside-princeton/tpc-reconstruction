To process a run, use the following command:

./waveTPC -c CONFIG_FILE -d PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_DATA ANALYSIS_MODE 

Possible ANALYSIS_MODE options include:
	 --noise         (for Noise Characterization)
	 --SiPM          (for SiPM Characterization)
	 --generate      (for generating simulated waveforms)
	 --TPC           (for TPC Runs)
	 --display       (for running the Event Viewer to plot analysis on individual channels)
	 --TPC --display (for running the Event Viewer to plot analysis performed in TPC Runs)

To process a subset of the data, add the following argument:
   --nevents NUM_EVENTS
